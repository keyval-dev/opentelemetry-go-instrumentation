# OpenTelemetry Go Auto-Instrumentation

This project adds [OpenTelemetry instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumenting/#automatic-instrumentation)
to Go applications without having to modify their source code.

We support a wide range of Go versions (1.12+) and even work on stripped binaries.

The automatic instrumentation is based on [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) uprobes. For more information, see our [How it works]() document.

## Getting Started

Check out our [Getting Started on Kubernetes]() guide for easily instrumenting your first Go applications.
